# Dimitra
An Agtech solution for wineries | 1st Prize at CruiseInn 2018

This is the repository for the demo used to present Dimitra at the CruiseInn 2018 Innovation competition. 

The demo is using an arduino that measures certain conditions and relay the information to an esp8226 via serial. 
The esp reports the measurements to a flask server that in turn hosts and updates the GUI of our system. In the GUI there are certain
charts that update realtime and certain charts that are mockups.

The demo was coded overnight.
